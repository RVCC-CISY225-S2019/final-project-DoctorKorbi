# Final Project
Web Dev I Final Project

This repo is for my Web Development I class at Raritan Valley Community College. This webpage represents everything we have learned throughout the semester including, but not limited to, web design best practices, grids, forms, navigation, mobile first design and styling with CSS. It also includes the research topic of my choice, animation using CSS, with a working demonstration.
